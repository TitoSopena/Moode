  He came to the United States in 1884 and briefly worked with Thomas Edison before the two parted ways.
  He sold several patent rights, including those to his alternating-current machinery,
  to George Westinghouse. His 1891 invention, the Tesla Coil is still used in radio technology today.
  Tesla died in New York City on January 7, 1943.",
